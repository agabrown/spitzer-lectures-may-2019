Gaia-Enceladus stellar mass was about 6x10^8.

MW current stellar mass about 4x10^10

So although merger event was 4:1 in total mass *at the time*, Gaia-Enceladus
has only added a about 1.5 per cent of stellar mass of MW. So the conclusions
in the paper are not in contradiction with Ostriker's assertion that most
stars in the Milky Way formed in situ.
